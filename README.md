# EncryptHat

EncryptHat is a mobile application developed in Flutter. It was designed as a final challenge for admission to the Security in Computing Laboratory at UFSC. The application is capable of scanning Bluetooth devices and storing them in a list. It also allows the user to generate a custom-sized key pair, and then sign the list of devices using the private key. Finally, it verifies the signature's validity using the public key.
